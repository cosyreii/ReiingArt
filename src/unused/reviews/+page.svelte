			I commissioned Reii to make some emotes for my discord server and YouTube channel. She went
			above and beyond and created a bunch of cute little emotes that me and my community adore!
			Reii is super talented, you'd be silly not to commission her artwork! She is also so easy to
			communicate with and such a lovely person ðŸ™‚ GET YOUR COMMISSIONS IN ASAP!!

			After years of working on projects with dozens of independent artists, my best experience has
			been with Reii. Her commission work is fairly priced and of high quality. Reii is easy to talk
			to and workshop ideas with, and she always dawns a friendly, warm demeanor that makes the
			commission process genuinely enjoyable and exciting! She's never failed to meet any of my
			deadlines, and has made revisions and changes when requested. What I found to be the icing on
			the cake is that Reii shares the interest in her work she's get gets commissioned, and strives
			to make sure that I'm always satisfied with the final product.

			To anyone seeking to commission anything from a ginormous collage to a small set of emotes,
			Reii is a fantastic option who never ceases to provide S tier quality work, and is a joy to
			work with :&#41;

<!-- Yukihara: Working with reii was great. I had only vague ideas of what i wanted but she stayed
patient and worked it all out with me and putting it into practice way better than I thought it
could come out. We sat in vc for like an hour and she made sure to walk me through every step. Even
making adjustments (being coloring, adding stuff, removing stuff) were no problem and fast. Overall
it was a blast working with her. -->

<!-- Smolminy: My experience with Reii was impeccable. They inspired me
and worked closely with me to create beautiful concepts (a character and matching emotes). They were
extremely patient and attentive with me which is super important as I am an individual with a few
disabilities. Super accommodating. The artwork itself came out so lovely, they have a keen eye for
detail that's for sure. They are my go to artist and I would recommend using their services - you
won't regret it. -->

<!-- Kwondor: I first came across Reiiâ€™s work through a previous client and mutual friend, and I
immediately fell in love with her style of art. Reii is not only incredibly talented but also a joy
to work with: patient, kind, and understanding throughout every step of the process, refusing to
rest until her clients are 100% satisfied. -->
