			I commissioned Reii to make some emotes for my discord server and YouTube channel. She went
			above and beyond and created a bunch of cute little emotes that me and my community adore!
			Reii is super talented, you'd be silly not to commission her artwork! She is also so easy to
			communicate with and such a lovely person ðŸ™‚ GET YOUR COMMISSIONS IN ASAP!!

			After years of working on projects with dozens of independent artists, my best experience has
			been with Reii. Her commission work is fairly priced and of high quality. Reii is easy to talk
			to and workshop ideas with, and she always dawns a friendly, warm demeanor that makes the
			commission process genuinely enjoyable and exciting! She's never failed to meet any of my
			deadlines, and has made revisions and changes when requested. What I found to be the icing on
			the cake is that Reii shares the interest in her work she's get gets commissioned, and strives
			to make sure that I'm always satisfied with the final product.

			To anyone seeking to commission anything from a ginormous collage to a small set of emotes,
			Reii is a fantastic option who never ceases to provide S tier quality work, and is a joy to
			work with :&#41;
